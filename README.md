# Orbit: Galileo Constellation Simulator



Orbit is an interactive 3D web-based simulation of the Galileo satellite constellation, built with Three.js.
The project visualizes the orbits and positions of Galileo satellites in real-time, providing an intuitive way to explore the structure and 
dynamics of the constellation.
## Features
- 3D Visualization: Realistic rendering of satellite orbits and Earth using WebGL and Three.js.
- Interactive Controls:
Rotate, zoom, and pan around the scene to inspect satellite trajectories from any angle.
- Galileo Constellation Model: Displays all operational Galileo satellites, their orbits, and relative positions in space.
- Web-Based: Accessible via any modern web browser with no installation required.

**This project is currently being developed.**
